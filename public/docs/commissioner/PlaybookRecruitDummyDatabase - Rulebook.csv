Format,"<strong>Dynasty</strong><br/>The league will be true dynasty format. Players will never decay based on team tenure or be force dropped from a roster. Following the start-up draft, all subsequent yearly drafts will be rookie-only drafts.<br/><br/><strong>12 Teams</strong><br/>Each team will have a roster of up to 21 players, three being Injury Reserve slots only available to sufficiently injured players. We will also have five Minor League slots for younger players to be stashed. To be eligible for Minor League you must have played less than 175 games. Only 10 players may be active on any given day (as players on the bench do not add to team scoring totals), and owners will be free to change which players are active each day prior to the tip-off time of the opening game of the day.<br/><br/>All further League rule decisions for either rule changes or rules not listed on these pages will be subject to a league-wide vote."
Matchups,"<strong>Head to Head - Each Category</strong><br/>FG%, FT%, 3PM, PTS, REB, AST, STL, BLK, TO<br/><br/>We play Head to Head - Each Category (Weekly) with the standard 9-cat setup. For each weekly scoring period, team totals in all 9 categories are accumulated and a win, loss or tie is credited in each category based on the matchup results (i.e. 5-3-1 in a 9 category league).<br/><br/>There will be a <strong>hard cap limit of 40 games played</strong> for each scoring period. You will maintain all stats from games played on the day you reach the cap, regardless if it exceeds the cap slightly. These matchup results are added over the course of the season and are totaled as season standings.<br/><br/>The teams in the top 6 places in the season standings at the end of the season will enter the playoffs. (See the Playoffs section for more.)<br/><br/>Rosters will lock individually at the time of each player's respective game times."
Prize Pool,"A <strong>$75 league buy-in fee</strong> will be collected from all members prior to the 2019 start-up draft. Once all buy-in fees have been paid, both the draft and the league will start.<br/><br/>To ensure competitive integrity and longevity in the dynasty format, the league buy-in fee <strong>for all subsequent seasons will be collected ahead of schedule</strong>. Any owner who fails to submit their buy-in fee for the following season by the deadline will forfeit their place in the league and will not be able to collect any prize money, even for the current season.<br/><br/><strong>This makes the prize pool $900.</strong><br/>• 1st place will receive $550<br/>• 2nd place will receive $275<br/>• 3rd place will receive $75"
Trades,"Trades must abide by all owner conduct rules. One of the key responsibilities of each owner as part of <strong>your commitment to this league is the competitive integrity</strong> of trading. Please be diligent and cautious when making trades, as it critically affects the experiences of all other owners in the league.<br/><br/>Trading and its effects on competitive integrity will be each owner's responsibility. In 99% of situations, you will be the one accountable for your own actions, and will be required to live with them along with the rest of us.<br/><br/><strong>The league will be commissioner veto only</strong>, with an agenda of being as hands off as possible. In extreme situations only, if a trade is deemed by the commissioner to be excessively self-destructive or nonsensical, it will be discussed and likely reversed.<br/><br/>In any unusual situation whereby a team (through technological error) completes an accidental trade that can be explained reasonably and is reported in league chat or to the commissioner directly <strong>within 5-10 minutes</strong> of the trade occurring can be reversed.<br/><br/>Please double and triple check your trades before and after they are executed, to be able to catch any honest mistakes and message the commissioner in time to take advantage of this forgiveness period. All other trades will be upheld."
Owner Conduct,"<strong>No collusion.</strong> Fraternizing with, or manipulating, another player in private to achieve an outcome that could disrupt another team's fair chances of success and/or tip the competitive balance in your favor.<br/><br/><strong>No sandbagging.</strong> You must always be engaged, playing and setting coherent lineups, regardless of the strength of your team. Season ""tanking"" is allowed only through trading.<br/><br/><strong>Set your lineups.</strong> The absolute minimum requirement for playing in the league is making sure your roster is properly placed and off the bench for every matchup. It's your responsibility to make sure that your match-ups' competitive integrity isn't spoiled by your ineptness or indifference towards this essential duty.<br/><br/><strong>No roster self-destructing.</strong> Any malicious or nonsensical player drops or trades reasonably diagnosed as reckless and indicative of a player choosing to disregard the competitive integrity of the league will be undone and if needed, the offending team will be held frozen until a replacement owner can be found."
Draft,"The draft will commence some time after the <strong>July 1st beginning of free agency</strong>, once all major free agents have signed and settled.<br/><br/>The start-up draft will be a snake draft, and all subsequent drafts will be linear draft format, much like the real NBA draft. (1st pick will also get 13th pick.)<br/><br/>Draft position for all future rookie drafts will be selected based on previous season standings, with one exception. The 12th, 11th, and 10th place teams from the previous season will be placed in a random <strong>draft lottery</strong> to decide who gets the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd pick in the draft.<br/><br/>Every pick following will be assigned in reverse order of the previous year's standings. 9th place will get the 4th pick, 8th place will get the 5th pick, and so on.<br/><br/>The draft lottery results will be decided by a random choice of 3 mixed ping pong balls assigned to each of the 3 worst standing teams from the previous season. First ball selection will have the 1st pick, the second ball selection will have the 2nd pick, and the leftover team gets the 3rd pick.<br/><br/>"
Waiver,"We will use FAAB waivers with $100 refreshing at the beginning of each season - no rollover budget. After the draft, all players not drafted will enter into the Waiver Wire system. Every player on the waiver wire will be available to any owner to make a claim on for 1 day. The winner of the waiver claim will be decided by Waiver Wire Order, and any players not claimed with the waiver wire period will become a Free Agent.<br/><br/>All Free Agents are first come first serve, and do not affect Waiver Order. If you successfully claim a player from the waiver wire, your Waiver Order will drop to last priority.<br/><br/>We will have rolling waivers with a non-waiver free agency period for all unclaimed free agents starting at 10AM PST until the beginning of their individual game (or the start of the final game if they have no game) at which point they will become waiver wire (FAAB bid) candidates until the following day at 10AM."
Playoffs,"<strong>6 teams will enter the playoffs</strong> after the regular season matchups, these teams are decided by league standings at the end of the season.<br/><br/><strong>First round:</strong> Seeds (1) and (2) will both get a bye. Two matchups will be played between seeds (3) vs. (6) and seeds (4) vs. (5).<br/><br/><strong>Second round:</strong> The playoff bracket will be reseeded, placing seed (1) against the lowest available seed to make it out of the first round. Seed (2) will be placed against the other first round victor.<br/><br/><strong>Third and final round:</strong> The two winners of the second round of matchups will face off to decide who gets 1st place and 2nd place prizes - the losers will face off in a third place matchup.<br/><br/><strong>Scoring Periods:</strong><br/>• First and second round matchups: <strong>one week each</strong><br/>• Third round prize matchup: <strong>two weeks</strong><br/><br/>(To be clear, there is no preset option on Fantrax to set up two week playoffs, but I will be able to customize playoffs and create the same matchup for two consecutive weeks, and the totals will be added together to crown the 1st prize winner.)"
