Please make sure to keep to the current tooling as much as possible unless there's a sigificant and/or meaningful reason to look outside of it. I'm using Javascript, Next.js 15+ (App Router for pages, but still using /pages/api/XYZ for api routes), MongoDB (no Mongoose or schemas), Zustand, auth0, Tailwind, Vercel, ShadCN for the base template styling of components, Fuse.js for fuzzy matching.
